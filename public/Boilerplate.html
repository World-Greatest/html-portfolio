        <h1>My First Website using the HTML boilerplate</h1>
        <h2>World Greatest</h2>
        <p>Omo it has been a fun ride up to this point.
           I think my biggest challenge has been to able to make images which also serves as links but on the bright side i believe i got the hack.
           The href anchor tags and the link after with you comes the closing angle bracket and another opening angle bracket followed by img and src the thr file path of the image.</p>
           
           <p>Here is an example<br>
            <a href="../4.1 Webpages/public/about.html"><img src="../assets/images/About Me.jpg" alt="World Greatest"/> </a>
           </p>

        <h2>This i've learnt so far:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Heading Element</li>
                <li>Paragraph Element</li>
                <li>Void Elements:<br>
                    Now in Void elements we have thing like:<br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Horizontal Line Rule</li>
                            <li>Break Rule</li>
                        </ol>
                <li>List Elements:<br>
                    In List elements we have things like:<br>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Ordered List (ol)</li>
                            <li>Unordered List (ul)</li>
                        </ol></li>
                <li>Nesting and Indentation <br>
                    You need to see the way the code for this page is omo (E too sharp oooo, No go dey)
                </li>
                <li>Anchor Elements</li>
                <li>Image Elements</li>
                <li>File Paths</li>
                <li>Multiple Webpages</li>
                <li>How a Proper HTML is supposed to look like</li>
            </ul>   
        <p>In all it has been a bitter sweet ride and i don't want to stop now, on my way to be a full stack developer.<br>
           I know that on the long run things might get difficult but hey, that is how it is supposed to be<br>
